# UGOS scripts

This repository contains helper scripts and services for [UGOS](https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/operating-system) (UGREEN NASync OS).

## Dislaimer

Before using these scripts, you should have a basic understanding of Linux and terminal commands like `cd`, `mkdir`, `nano`, `cat`, `chmod`, `systemctl` and `ssh`. You should always backup your system configuration in case you break something. 

**I am not responsible if you break your system, proceed at your own risk.**
